# Detecting Objects in Real Time with OpenCV deep learning library

# How does YOLO-v3 Algorithm works for this example case:
# STEP1: Reading stream video from camera

# STEP4: Getting blob from the frame
# STEP5: Getting Bounding Boxes
# STEP6: Non-maximum Suppression
# STEP7: Drawing Bounding Boxes with Labels
