# YOLOv3-video-detection

YOLO trained on the COCO dataset. The COCO dataset consists of 80 labels. You can fetch the weights from the link below

The directories structure should as follow:
•	yolo-coco-data/
 : The YOLOv3 object detector pre-trained (on the COCO dataset) model files. These were trained by the Darknet team should be kept here.
•	images/
 : This folder should contain static images which we will be used to perform object detection on for testing and evaluation purposes.
•	videos/
 : This directory should contains sample test videos for testing. After performing object detection with YOLO on video, we’ll process videos in real time camera input. 
•	output/
 : Output videos that have been processed by YOLO and annotated with bounding boxes and class names will appear at this location.
