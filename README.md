# YOLOv3-video-detection
This AIM of this repository is to create  real time / video application using Deep Learning based Object Detection using YOLOv3 with OpenCV
YOLO trained on the COCO dataset. The COCO dataset consists of 80 labels.

### Dependencies
<ul>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/" >YOLO</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://opencv.org/" >OpenCV</a>
    </li>
</ul>

You also need to download the `yolo.weights` file and place it as described below :

You can download the weights by - 
```
    $ wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
    or 
    https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names
```

The directories structure should as follow:

yolo-coco-data/
 : The YOLOv3 object detector pre-trained (on the COCO dataset) model files. These were trained by the Darknet team should be kept here.

images/
 : This folder should contain static images which we will be used to perform object detection on for testing and evaluation purposes.

videos/
 : This directory should contains sample test videos for testing. After performing object detection with YOLO on video, weâ€™ll process videos in real time camera input. Also Output videos that have been processed by YOLO and annotated with bounding boxes and class names will appear at this location.
